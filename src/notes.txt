22 Jan 2001:

* I finally got a hold on attributes (like _far, _near) and declspec (like 
dllimport, dllexport).

Attributes can be considered qualifiers (they are allowed in the same 
places and have teh same semantic binding). This allows for declarations like
const _far volatile int x;

Declspec can be considered storage classes using the same reasoning. 

23 Jan 2001:

* Still, not quite sure how to treat the GCC attributes. It seems they can
appear almost everywhere although their meaning applies to the declaration ?

* Once more I am speachless after looking at the GCC sources. Dozens of 
.C files larger than 100K, 300K, some even 400K ... and this is not
machine generated code !

I don't particulary like the coding style: the old-style function headers 
(although I realize that they are needed for bootstrapping on any platform),
the absurdly long files, the expressions that span dozens of line. It doesn't
leave me with a sense of clean, tight code, but rather of a unmanageable mess 
(which is of course partly due to my unfamiliarity with the code).

They do use garbage collection. It isn't Boehm's conservative collector
but their own which operates on some data structures used in the compiler. 


* Ok, in order to implement the type system we need to be able to build
expression trees since the size of an array may be variable. In the
general case we can assume that is an expression tree. We don't even need
to fold it as long as we know that it is constant (it may be a flag).

If we are to support expression statements nicely, we have to be able
to put them in the expression tree as well. So, we need statement trees as 
well.

GCC doesn't accept this code:
  void test ( int n, int a[{int x; x = n * 10; x}] )
complaining that statement-expressions are valid only in function
scope. I however think that in order to be logically consistent we have
to assume that expression statements are valid whereever an inline function
can be called. Consequently we must be able to accept the above code, or
at least we shall assume so for now. We can always add the restriction 
later.

So, for types we need everything:
symbol tables, expression trees, statement trees. 
We might as well make the scanner return expression trees directly for
constants.

31 Jab 2001:

An intriguing idea about instrinsic functions.
#define _memcpy( _d, _s, _l )
  ({
    void * dest = _d;
    const void * src = _s;
    unsigned len = _l;

    _ESI = src;
    _EDI = dest;

  $if isConst(len)
    $dwc = value(len) / 4
    $dwb = value(len) % 4
    $if dwc > 3
      _ECX = $dwc;
      __asm rep movsd
    $else
      $for i = 1 to dwc
        __asm movsd
      $endfor
    $endif
    $if dwb > 3
      _ECX = $dwb;
      __asm rep movsb
    $else
      $for i = 1 to dwc
        __asm movsb
      $endfor
    $endif
  $else
    _ECX = len;
    __asm {
      mov eax, ecx
      shr ecx, 2
      rep movsd
      mov ecx, eax
      and ecx, 3
      rep movsb
    }
  $endif

    return dest;
  })


12 June 2002:  

The current structure of types: 

  qual(ptr to typedef) -> type

could create problems with typedefs. Let's examine these declarations:

  typedef int Int;
  typedef const Int CInt;
  typedef volatile CInt VCInt;

We get:
  Int   = no_qual(Int) -> int
  CInt  = const(CInt)  -> int
  VCInt = volatile+const(VCInt) -> int

So, there is no way to determine that VCInt is in fact a "volatile CInt". All
we know is that it is a "volatile const int". This, of course, is good enough
for semantic analysis and code generation, but one keeps wondering whether
the addition information could be useful (e.g. for better error messages).

The same problem appears in declarations:
  volatile CInt x;
will produce:
  x = volatile+const(no_typedef) -> int

For now I don't think the benefit of doing it in some other way is worth the 
significant complication.


14 Jan 2003:

* Working on declarations. A few things which I did not know, or I did not 
realize:

- 6.7.1.4 (100) The implementation may treat any register declaration simply as an auto declaration. However,
whether or not addressable storage is actually used, the address of any part of an object declared with
storage-class specifier register cannot be computed, either explicitly (by use of the unary &
operator as discussed in 6.5.3.2) or implicitly (by converting an array name to a pointer as discussed in
6.3.2.1). Thus, the only operator that can be applied to an array declared with storage-class specifier
register is sizeof.

- If at the end of the translation unit containing
int i[];
the array i still has incomplete type, the implicit initializer causes it to have one element, which is set to
zero on program startup.

* Declarations:

6.2.2 Linkages of identifiers
=======================================================

1 An identifier declared in different scopes or in the same scope more than once can be
made to refer to the same object or function by a process called linkage.21) There are
three kinds of linkage: external, internal, and none.

2 In the set of translation units and libraries that constitutes an entire program, each
declaration of a particular identifier with external linkage denotes the same object or
function. Within one translation unit, each declaration of an identifier with internal
linkage denotes the same object or function. Each declaration of an identifier with no
linkage denotes a unique entity.

3 If the declaration of a file scope identifier for an object or a function contains the storageclass
specifier static, the identifier has internal linkage.22)

4 For an identifier declared with the storage-class specifier extern in a scope in which a
prior declaration of that identifier is visible,23) if the prior declaration specifies internal or
external linkage, the linkage of the identifier at the later declaration is the same as the
linkage specified at the prior declaration. If no prior declaration is visible, or if the prior
declaration specifies no linkage, then the identifier has external linkage.

5 If the declaration of an identifier for a function has no storage-class specifier, its linkage
is determined exactly as if it were declared with the storage-class specifier extern. If
the declaration of an identifier for an object has file scope and no storage-class specifier,
its linkage is external.

6 The following identifiers have no linkage: an identifier declared to be anything other than
an object or a function; an identifier declared to be a function parameter; a block scope
identifier for an object declared without the storage-class specifier extern.

7 If, within a translation unit, the same identifier appears with both internal and external
linkage, the behavior is undefined.

21) There is no linkage between different identifiers.
22) A function declaration can contain the storage-class specifier static only if it is at file scope; see
    6.7.1.


6.2.5 Types
=======================================================

1 The meaning of a value stored in an object or returned by a function is determined by the
type of the expression used to access it. (An identifier declared to be an object is the
simplest such expression; the type is specified in the declaration of the identifier.) Types
are partitioned into object types (types that fully describe objects), function types (types
that describe functions), and incomplete types (types that describe objects but lack
information needed to determine their sizes).

19 The void type comprises an empty set of values; it is an incomplete type that cannot be
completed.

22 An array type of unknown size is an incomplete type. It is completed, for an identifier of
that type, by specifying the size in a later declaration (with internal or external linkage).
A structure or union type of unknown content (as described in 6.7.2.3) is an incomplete
type. It is completed, for all declarations of that type, by declaring the same structure or
union tag with its defining content later in the same scope.

6.2.7 Compatible type and composite type
=======================================================

1 Two types have compatible type if their types are the same. Additional rules for
determining whether two types are compatible are described in 6.7.2 for type specifiers,
in 6.7.3 for type qualifiers, and in 6.7.5 for declarators.46) Moreover, two structure,
union, or enumerated types declared in separate translation units are compatible if their
tags and members satisfy the following requirements: If one is declared with a tag, the
other shall be declared with the same tag. If both are complete types, then the following
additional requirements apply: there shall be a one-to-one correspondence between their
members such that each pair of corresponding members are declared with compatible
types, and such that if one member of a corresponding pair is declared with a name, the
other member is declared with the same name. For two structures, corresponding
members shall be declared in the same order. For two structures or unions, corresponding
bit-fields shall have the same widths. For two enumerations, corresponding members
shall have the same values.

2 All declarations that refer to the same object or function shall have compatible type;
otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

3 Acomposite type can be constructed from two types that are compatible; it is a type that
is compatible with both of the two types and satisfies the following conditions:
— If one type is an array of known constant size, the composite type is an array of that
size; otherwise, if one type is a variable length array, the composite type is that type.
— If only one type is a function type with a parameter type list (a function prototype),
the composite type is a function prototype with the parameter type list.
— If both types are function types with parameter type lists, the type of each parameter
in the composite parameter type list is the composite type of the corresponding
parameters.
These rules apply recursively to the types from which the two types are derived.

4 For an identifier with internal or external linkage declared in a scope in which a prior
declaration of that identifier is visible,47) if the prior declaration specifies internal or
external linkage, the type of the identifier at the later declaration becomes the composite
type.


6.7 Declarations
=======================================================

Constraints

2 A declaration shall declare at least a declarator (other than the parameters of a function or
the members of a structure or union), a tag, or the members of an enumeration.

3 If an identifier has no linkage, there shall be no more than one declaration of the identifier
(in a declarator or type specifier) with the same scope and in the same name space, except
for tags as specified in 6.7.2.3.

4 All declarations in the same scope that refer to the same object or function shall specify
compatible types.

Semantics

5 A declaration specifies the interpretation and attributes of a set of identifiers. A definition
of an identifier is a declaration for that identifier that:
— for an object, causes storage to be reserved for that object;
— for a function, includes the function body;98)
— for an enumeration constant or typedef name, is the (only) declaration of the
identifier.

7 If an identifier for an object is declared with no linkage, the type for the object shall be
complete by the end of its declarator, or by the end of its init-declarator if it has an
initializer; in the case of function arguments (including in prototypes), it is the adjusted
type (see 6.7.5.3) that is required to be complete.

6.7.1 Storage-class specifiers
=======================================================

Constraints

2 At most, one storage-class specifier may be given in the declaration specifiers in a
declaration.99)

4 A declaration of an identifier for an object with storage-class specifier register
suggests that access to the object be as fast as possible. The extent to which such
suggestions are effective is implementation-defined.100)
100) The implementation may treat any register declaration simply as an auto declaration. However,
whether or not addressable storage is actually used, the address of any part of an object declared with
storage-class specifier register cannot be computed, either explicitly (by use of the unary &
operator as discussed in 6.5.3.2) or implicitly (by converting an array name to a pointer as discussed in
6.3.2.1). Thus, the only operator that can be applied to an array declared with storage-class specifier
register is sizeof.

5 The declaration of an identifier for a function that has block scope shall have no explicit
storage-class specifier other than extern.

6 If an aggregate or union object is declared with a storage-class specifier other than
typedef, the properties resulting from the storage-class specifier, except with respect to
linkage, also apply to the members of the object, and so on recursively for any aggregate
or union member objects.


6.7.2 Type specifiers
=======================================================

Semantics
4 Specifiers for structures, unions, and enumerations are discussed in 6.7.2.1 through
6.7.2.3. Declarations of typedef names are discussed in 6.7.7. The characteristics of the
other types are discussed in 6.2.5.

6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers
=======================================================

Constraints

2 A structure or union shall not contain a member with incomplete or function type (hence,
a structure shall not contain an instance of itself, but may contain a pointer to an instance
of itself), except that the last member of a structure with more than one named member
may have incomplete array type; such a structure (and any union containing, possibly
recursively, a member that is such a structure) shall not be a member of a structure or an
element of an array.

3 The expression that specifies the width of a bit-field shall be an integer constant
expression that has nonnegative value that shall not exceed the number of bits in an object
of the type that is specified if the colon and expression are omitted. If the value is zero,
the declaration shall have no declarator.

4 A bit-field shall have a type that is a qualified or unqualified version of _Bool, signed
int, unsigned int, or some other implementation-defined type.

7 The presence of a struct-declaration-list in a struct-or-union-specifier declares a new type,
within a translation unit. The struct-declaration-list is a sequence of declarations for the
members of the structure or union. If the struct-declaration-list contains no named
members, the behavior is undefined. The type is incomplete until after the } that
terminates the list.

8 A member of a structure or union may have any object type other than a variably
modified type.102) In addition, a member may be declared to consist of a specified
number of bits (including a sign bit, if any). Such a member is called a bit-field;103) its
width is preceded by a colon.

11 A bit-field declaration with no declarator, but only a colon and a width, indicates an
unnamed bit-field.105) As a special case, a bit-field structure member with a width of 0
indicates that no further bit-field is to be packed into the unit in which the previous bit-
field, if any, was placed.

6.7.2.3 Tags
=======================================================

Constraints

1 A specific type shall have its content defined at most once.

2 A type specifier of the form
enum identifier
without an enumerator list shall only appear after the type it specifies is complete.

Semantics

3 All declarations of structure, union, or enumerated types that have the same scope and
use the same tag declare the same type. The type is incomplete109) until the closing brace
of the list defining the content, and complete thereafter.

4 Tw o declarations of structure, union, or enumerated types which are in different scopes or
use different tags declare distinct types. Each declaration of a structure, union, or
enumerated type which does not include a tag declares a distinct type.

6 A declaration of the form
struct-or-union identifier ;
specifies a structure or union type and declares the identifier as a tag of that type.111)
111) A similar construction with enum does not exist. (!!!)

7 If a type specifier of the form
struct-or-union identifier
occurs other than as part of one of the above forms, and no other declaration of the
identifier as a tag is visible, then it declares an incomplete structure or union type, and
declares the identifier as the tag of that type.111)

8 If a type specifier of the form
struct-or-union identifier
or
enum identifier
occurs other than as part of one of the above forms, and a declaration of the identifier as a
tag is visible, then it specifies the same type as that other declaration, and does not
redeclare the tag.

6.7.3 Type qualifiers
=======================================================

Constraints
2 Types other than pointer types derived from object or incomplete types shall not be
restrict-qualified.

8 If the specification of an array type includes any type qualifiers, the element type is soqualified,
not the array type. If the specification of a function type includes any type
qualifiers, the behavior is undefined.116)
116) Both of these can occur through the use of typedefs.


6.7.4 Function specifiers
=======================================================

Constraints

2 Function specifiers shall be used only in the declaration of an identifier for a function.

3 An inline definition of a function with external linkage shall not contain a definition of a
modifiable object with static storage duration, and shall not contain a reference to an
identifier with internal linkage.

4 In a hosted environment, the inline function specifier shall not appear in a declaration
of main.

Semantics

5 A function declared with an inline function specifier is an inline function. The
function specifier may appear more than once; the behavior is the same as if it appeared
only once. Making a function an inline function suggests that calls to the function be as
fast as possible.118) The extent to which such suggestions are effective is
implementation-defined.119)

6 Any function with internal linkage can be an inline function. For a function with external
linkage, the following restrictions apply: If a function is declared with an inline
function specifier, then it shall also be defined in the same translation unit. If all of the
file scope declarations for a function in a translation unit include the inline function
specifier without extern, then the definition in that translation unit is an inline
definition. An inline definition does not provide an external definition for the function,
and does not forbid an external definition in another translation unit. An inline definition
provides an alternative to an external definition, which a translator may use to implement
any call to the function in the same translation unit. It is unspecified whether a call to the
function uses the inline definition or the external definition.120)


6.7.5.2 Array declarators
=======================================================

Constraints

1 In addition to optional type qualifiers and the keyword static, the [ and ] may delimit
an expression or *. If they delimit an expression (which specifies the size of an array), the
expression shall have an integer type. If the expression is a constant expression, it shall
have a value greater than zero. The element type shall not be an incomplete or function
type. The optional type qualifiers and the keyword static shall appear only in a
declaration of a function parameter with an array type, and then only in the outermost
array type derivation.

2 Only an ordinary identifier (as defined in 6.2.3) with both block scope or function
prototype scope and no linkage shall have a variably modified type. If an identifier is
declared to be an object with static storage duration, it shall not have a variable length
array type.

Semantics

4 If the size is not present, the array type is an incomplete type. If the size is * instead of
being an expression, the array type is a variable length array type of unspecified size,
which can only be used in declarations with function prototype scope;122) such arrays are
nonetheless complete types. If the size is an integer constant expression and the element
type has a known constant size, the array type is not a variable length array type;
otherwise, the array type is a variable length array type.

5 If the size is an expression that is not an integer constant expression: if it occurs in a
declaration at function prototype scope, it is treated as if it were replaced by *; otherwise,
each time it is evaluated it shall have a value greater than zero. The size of each instance
of a variable length array type does not change during its lifetime. Where a size
expression is part of the operand of a sizeof operator and changing the value of the
size expression would not affect the result of the operator, it is unspecified whether or not
the size expression is evaluated.

6 For two array types to be compatible, both shall have compatible element types, and if
both size specifiers are present, and are integer constant expressions, then both size
specifiers shall have the same constant value. If the two array types are used in a context
which requires them to be compatible, it is undefined behavior if the two size specifiers
evaluate to unequal values.

6.7.5.3 Function declarators (including prototypes)
=======================================================

Constraints

1 A function declarator shall not specify a return type that is a function type or an array
type.

2 The only storage-class specifier that shall occur in a parameter declaration is register.

3 An identifier list in a function declarator that is not part of a definition of that function
shall be empty.

4 After adjustment, the parameters in a parameter type list in a function declarator that is
part of a definition of that function shall not have incomplete type.

Semantics

7 A declaration of a parameter as ‘‘array of type’’ shall be adjusted to ‘‘qualified pointer to
type’’, where the type qualifiers (if any) are those specified within the [ and ] of the
array type derivation. If the keyword static also appears within the [ and ] of the
array type derivation, then for each call to the function, the value of the corresponding
actual argument shall provide access to the first element of an array with at least as many
elements as specified by the size expression.

8 A declaration of a parameter as ‘‘function returning type’’ shall be adjusted to ‘‘pointer to
function returning type’’, as in 6.3.2.1.

9 If the list terminates with an ellipsis (, ...), no information about the number or types
of the parameters after the comma is supplied.123)

10 The special case of an unnamed parameter of type void as the only item in the list
specifies that the function has no parameters.

12 If the function declarator is not part of a definition of that function, parameters may have
incomplete type and may use the [*] notation in their sequences of declarator specifiers
to specify variable length array types.

13 The storage-class specifier in the declaration specifiers for a parameter declaration, if
present, is ignored unless the declared parameter is one of the members of the parameter
type list for a function definition.

14 An identifier list declares only the identifiers of the parameters of the function. An empty
list in a function declarator that is part of a definition of that function specifies that the
function has no parameters. The empty list in a function declarator that is not part of a
definition of that function specifies that no information about the number or types of the
parameters is supplied.124)

15 For two function types to be compatible, both shall specify compatible return types.125)
Moreover, the parameter type lists, if both are present, shall agree in the number of
parameters and in use of the ellipsis terminator; corresponding parameters shall have
compatible types. If one type has a parameter type list and the other type is specified by a
function declarator that is not part of a function definition and that contains an empty
identifier list, the parameter list shall not have an ellipsis terminator and the type of each
parameter shall be compatible with the type that results from the application of the
default argument promotions. If one type has a parameter type list and the other type is
specified by a function definition that contains a (possibly empty) identifier list, both shall
agree in the number of parameters, and the type of each prototype parameter shall be
compatible with the type that results from the application of the default argument
promotions to the type of the corresponding identifier. (In the determination of type
compatibility and of a composite type, each parameter declared with function or array
type is taken as having the adjusted type and each parameter declared with qualified type
is taken as having the unqualified version of its declared type.)

6.7.7 Type definitions
=======================================================

Constraints

2 If a typedef name specifies a variably modified type then it shall have block scope.

Semantics

3 In a declaration whose storage-class specifier is typedef, each declarator defines an
identifier to be a typedef name that denotes the type specified for the identifier in the way
described in 6.7.5. Any array size expressions associated with variable length array
declarators are evaluated each time the declaration of the typedef name is reached in the
order of execution. A typedef declaration does not introduce a new type, only a
synonym for the type so specified.

28 June 2003
* Compiled the sources after a big reorganization. I have been trying to make the modules
(e.g. c-types, c-symtab, c-ast, etc.) independant of each other, but the truth of the 
matter is that it is simply impossible. As soon as I realized (again) that the CFE is one
big entity, it became much easier. All definitions are in cfe_priv.h, which is included by
all CFE files. Simple. There is improvement compared to before, since I have separated some
things in their own header files - this however is only for convenience - they are included
by cfe_priv.h.

* Explanation of the current directory structure, the "src" subtree:
E:\prog\c99\src
  +--cfe
  ¦  +--c
  ¦  ¦  +--srtuni
  ¦  +--h
  +--common
  ¦  +--c
  ¦  +--h

  ¦  +--c
  ¦  +--h
  ¦  +--i386
  ¦     +--cfe
  ¦     +--mach
  +--temp
  +--tests

\cfe - target-independant C Front End
\cfe\c - sources and private (CFE-only) headers
\cfe\c\srtuni - a simple tool that sorts Unicode characters in ranges for use in the scanner.

\common - stuff shared between all compiler modules
\common\c - c code and private (common-only) headers
\common\h - public headers

\out - output objects and binaries are stored there

\target - code to support the target
\target\c - target-independant code, which however is parametrized by target-dependant definitions.
\target\h - headers that wrap all target-dependant definitions together
\target\$(TGT) - support for target $(TGT) (e.g. i386)
\target\$(TGT)\cfe - CFE specific target dependant code
\target\$(TGT)\mach - front-end independant target specific code

\tests - compiler tests

The idea is that directories are separate modules. The \h subdirectories contains the public
(usable by other modules) headers. The \c subdirectories contains the code and private (usable
only within the module) headers.
The \target subtree is somewhat of an exception because the code there is used to parametrize
the front-end, and so \target\$(TGT)\cfe is actually treated as it if is also a part of \cfe.

During compile time the include path for each module are set to the corresponding \h directory
(public includes) and to the active target \target\$(TGT)\... . Usually I prefer to specify
full include paths, when possible, but the latter is necessary because at compile time there is 
no way to know the active target directories.
  
* Problem with redeclarations of global symbols.
Each redeclaration could potentially augment the type of the global symbol. For example:
  int A[];
  int A[10];
After the second declaration the type is not "int [10]".
However currently we always keep the first declaration. Consequtive declarations are checked
against the first type, not against the composite type. Continuiing the example, if a third 
declaration occurs:
  int A[5];
clearly it must be an error, but we don't catch that.

* Big improvement in declarations. The problems described in the previous section are solved.

* This statement causes a cascade of errros which seem strange at first:
typedef m n;

  stdin:(1) : warning: C99 forbids declarations without a specifier
  stdin:(1) : error: at 'n' : parse error, unexpected identifier
  stdin:(1) : error: 'm': does not have function type in function definition
  stdin:(1) : warning: Empty statement at file scope


It appears that we think that this is a function declaration. Probably old-style ?

-- Later 
That is the case indeed. When the error token is shifted it matches "declaration_list"
which describes an old-style function parameter list.
